          It's a Snakes game where you play vs the computer. The objective of
          the game is to make the other player crash. This project is aimed at
          developing a Multiplayer Snakes and Ladders Game, which can be played
          over LAN. This game has been built using C language. The snake game is
          simple game

        <h2>Introduction</h2>

        <p>
          • Snakes and ladders, or chutes and ladders, is a classic children's
          board game.<br />
          • It is played between 2 or more players on a playing board with
          numbered grid squares. <br />• On certain squares on the grid are
          drawn a number of "ladders" connecting two squares together, and a
          number of "snakes" or "chutes" also connecting squares together.<br />
          • The size of the grid (most commonly 8×8, 10×10 or 12×12) varies from
          board to board, as does the exact arrangement of the chutes and the
          ladders: both of these may affect the duration of game play
        </p>

        <h2>Instructions</h2>

        <p>
          1) The game starts on a first come first serve basis. <br />2) If the
          die rolled is six, the player will get another chance to roll the
          die.<br />
          3)There could be only one winner. Once a player wins (reaches the
          100th mark), the game is over. <br />4) The first player creates the
          game and pass phrase. <br />5) Others joining the game should know the
          pass phrase to join the game
        </p>
        <blockquote>
          <p>
            Single Mode: In this mode: "Player 1" -> User and "Player 2" ->
            Computer<br />
            Double Mode: Two players can play with the dice
          </p>

          <p>
            Throwing Dice: This is done by pressing the left button on "Player
            1". The counter is stopped when you release the button and the
            counter value is displayed on the Dice.<br />
            If player gets number six after throwing the dice, then the
            respective player is eligible for one more throw.
          </p>
